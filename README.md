# kvm-keypad
The keypad for the KVM switch I built. Contains a 3x3 array of buttons, allowing you to decide where monitor 1, monitor 2, and the USB devices are routed to, out of the three different computers supported by the base.

It connects via a PS/2 cable to [kvm-base](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/kvm-base)&mdash;however, it does _not_ use the actual PS/2 protocol.
