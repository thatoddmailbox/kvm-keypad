# kvm-keypad
The keypad for the [open-source HDMI KVM switch I built](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/kvm#kvm). It's a 3x3 array of buttons, allowing you to decide where monitor 1, monitor 2, and the USB devices are routed to.

It connects via a PS/2 cable to [kvm-base](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/kvm-base)&mdash;however, it does _not_ use the actual PS/2 protocol.
